          "Libra sign epitomizes balance and fairness. The sign restores equilibrium to all affairs, no matter how big or small it is. Libra individuals are fascinated by balance and symmetry. They enjoy keeping their brains stimulated with books, discussions and fighting for justice. They often self-indulge in expensive and beautiful things. They may even have a taste for the finer things in life. They will focus more on partnerships. Relationships are paramount for them. However, they will prioritize the needs of others.\nLibrans admire harmony and love gentleness and peace around them. Hence, they become mediators and patch up the quarrels happening between others whenever possible. They try to keep everyone happy and engaged. They are ruled by Venus and hence, adore high art, intellectualism, and connoisseurship. Also, they are cool, calculative, cerebral and charming. They can charm anyone and also draw many people to them. They are fond of social aspects as well.",
        career:
          "Libra natives always consider their colleagues as their close mates. You thrive in a company culture where there is low-drama, harmony, trustworthy employees and lots of fun working in a team. You find it a bit tough to work in a more buttoned-up and reserved environment. You avoid drama in the workplace. You are very creative and fun-loving and always try to have fun in the workplace. You bristle at rigidity, preferring to find your way when there is a lot of workload or when you have a hectic schedule. The big picture is far more important to you than the details. This means you may lose steam halfway through a projectâ€”especially without a team member to hold you accountable and cheer you to do more efforts.",
